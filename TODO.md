- Complete directory structure and scenes
- NetworkManager with multiplayer support (ENet + WebSockets)
- GameState management with buzzer system
- JSON game data loading and validation
- Board generation algorithm with randomization
- Data structures for Player and Question objects

**âœ… UI Implementation (Phase 2):**
- Main.tscn - Game manager scene
- MainMenu - Host/Join interface with IP input and file loading
- Lobby - Pre-game player list with start controls
- GameBoard - 6x5 question grid with player scores and buzzer
- QuestionDisplay - Modal popup for questions and answers
