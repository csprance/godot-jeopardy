```json
{
  "title": "My Custom Game",
  "description": "Custom trivia questions",
  "questions": [
    {
      "category": "SCIENCE",
      "question": "This element has the chemical symbol 'O'",
      "answer": "What is Oxygen?",
      "point_range": {
        "min": 200,
        "max": 400
      }
    }
  ],
  "board_config": {
    "categories_count": 6,
    "questions_per_category": 5,
    "point_values": [200, 400, 600, 800, 1000],
    "daily_doubles_count": 2
  }
}
```
